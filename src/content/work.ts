      "Lumen had prestige and silence. The brief was not awareness. It was to make the house felt in rooms that had forgotten it—without turning a fragrance into a lifestyle slogan. We built a season of film, editorial social, and a retail AR chapter that treated the bottle as an object of light, not a SKU.",
